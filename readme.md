## üéÆ Game Concept: "Creative Summer Academy"

Children attend a prestigious space academy where they learn different crafting skills to become Master Space Explorers. The academy features different space stations:

- **Art Lab** - Drawing and painting activities
- **Engineering Bay** - Building and construction projects  
- **Cosmic Jewelry Workshop** - Jewelry making and beading
- **Creative Station** - Mixed media and experimental crafts

### Gamification Elements
- **Points System** - 0-100 points per activity (reduced by 5 for each 5-minute extension)
- **Daily Progress** - Track activities completed and points earned each day
- **Visual Progress** - Academy campus grows and unlocks new areas
- **Ultimate Goal** - Become "Master Space Explorer" with accumulated points

## ü§ñ AI Prompt Template System

### Prompt Template Structure
The system uses a single template file (`templates/activity_prompt.ini`) that gets populated with child selections and recent activity history to generate unique, personalized activities.

**Template File: `templates/activity_prompt.ini`**
```ini
[base_prompt]
system_role = You are an expert children activity coordinator at a space-themed summer academy
target_audience = 8-year-old children with developing fine motor skills and creativity
confidence_level = You must have 95% confidence this activity is safe and appropriate

[activity_framework]
create_instruction = Create a fun {selected_category} activity that takes approximately {selected_duration} minutes
materials_instruction = Use at least {min_materials_count} of these available materials: {selected_materials}
learning_focus = The activity should help develop: {selected_objectives}
theme_integration = Incorporate a galactic space academy theme naturally into the activity

[output_structure]
title_requirement = Provide an exciting space-themed title
overview_requirement = Give a brief description of what the child will create and why it is cool
steps_requirement = Break down into clear, numbered steps using simple 8-year-old friendly language
time_guidance = Suggest rough time allocation for each major step
encouragement = Include positive, encouraging language throughout

[safety_and_quality]
safety_check = Ensure all steps are safe for 8-year-olds working with the specified materials
age_appropriateness = Verify fine motor skills required match 8-year-old capabilities
completion_confidence = Child should feel proud and accomplished when finished

[uniqueness_requirement]
avoid_repetition = Do NOT create activities similar to these recent activities: {recent_activities_summary}
ensure_variety = Make this activity distinctly different in approach, final product, and techniques used
```

### Template Variables
The system populates the template with:

**Child Selections:**
- `{selected_duration}` - Activity duration in minutes
- `{selected_materials}` - List of materials child selected
- `{selected_objectives}` - Learning objectives chosen
- `{selected_category}` - Activity category (building, painting, etc.)
- `{min_materials_count}` - Calculated as (selected materials count - 1)

**System Variables:**
- `{recent_activities_summary}` - Summary of last 5 activities to ensure uniqueness

**Example Populated Variables:**
```
{selected_duration} = 25
{selected_materials} = ["cardboard", "aluminum_foil", "markers", "scissors", "glue", "string"]
{min_materials_count} = 5
{selected_objectives} = ["engineering", "creativity"]
{selected_category} = building
{recent_activities_summary} = "1. Space helmet from cardboard, 2. Communication device with foil, 3. Robot friend with boxes, 4. Planet mobile with string, 5. Rocket ship painting"
```

## üé® MVP Activity System

### Child Activity Selection Process
1. **Duration Selection** - Choose activity length in 5-minute increments (admin configurable min/max)
2. **Material Selection** - Pick 3-8 materials from available list (admin configurable)
3. **Learning Objectives** - Select from options like "engineering", "creativity", "following_directions"
4. **Category Selection** - Choose from "building", "painting", "crafting", "jewelry making", etc.

### AI-Generated Activity Flow
```
Child Selections ‚Üí Template Population ‚Üí Anthropic API Prompt ‚Üí Generated Activity ‚Üí Review & Start
```

**API Integration:**
- Uses Anthropic's Claude API to generate activities with 95% confidence
- Activities tailored for 8-year-old development level
- Uses minimum (selected materials - 1) items in generated activity
- Includes last 5 activities to ensure uniqueness and avoid repetition
- 30-second retry with kid-friendly waiting message ("Do 10 jumping jacks while we create your activity!")

### Activity Execution
1. **Pre-Activity Preparation**
   - Show activity description, required materials, total time
   - "Grab all items, drink water, use bathroom" reminder
   - "Ready to Start" button initiates timer

2. **During Activity**
   - Real-time countdown timer
   - Option to extend 5 minutes at a time (maximum 2 extensions)
   - Each extension reduces max possible score by 5 points
   - Session recovery: automatically resume if tab closed/browser refreshed

3. **Activity Completion**
   - Timer completion enables parent scoring
   - Child cannot start new activity until parent provides score
   - "Regenerate activity" option available once per request (then 15-minute cooldown)


### Activity Structure Example

## üìã Rules Page Content

### Rules for Kids (Simple Language)

**üåü Welcome to Creative Summer Academy! üåü**

**How to Play:**
1. **Pick Your Activity** - Choose how long you want to craft, what materials to use, and what you want to learn!
2. **Get Ready** - Gather all your materials, drink some water, and use the bathroom
3. **Start Crafting** - Follow the steps and have fun creating!
4. **Finish Strong** - Try to finish in the time you picked to get the most points!

**Important Rules:**
- You can only do **3 activities each day**
- If you need more time, you can add 5 more minutes (but you'll get fewer points)
- You can only ask for extra time **2 times per activity**
- Wait for a grown-up to give you points before starting your next activity
- If you close your computer, don't worry! Come back and keep going where you left off

**Points:**
- Each activity can give you up to **100 points**
- If you use extra time once: **95 points maximum**
- If you use extra time twice: **90 points maximum**
- Collect points to become a **Master Space Explorer**!

### Rules for Parents/Guardians

**üéØ Creative Summer Academy Parent Guide**

**Scoring System:**
- Activities are scored 0-100 points based on effort, creativity, and completion
- Maximum score reduces by 5 points for each 5-minute extension used
- Scoring is only available after the child's selected duration is completed
- Each parent requires a unique password for scoring access

**Daily Limits:**
- Configurable maximum activities per day (default: 3)
- Configurable activity duration range (default: 10-30 minutes)
- 15-minute cooldown after using "regenerate activity" option

**Child Safety & Engagement:**
- All activities are AI-generated specifically for 8-year-old development level
- Activities use only pre-approved materials from your configuration
- Built-in preparation reminders (gather materials, hydration, bathroom)
- Session recovery ensures no lost progress from technical issues

**Administrative Controls:**
- Configure available materials, learning objectives, and categories
- Set daily limits and time restrictions
- View comprehensive activity reports and progress tracking
- Manage multiple parent accounts with unique access

**Activity Generation:**
- Uses Anthropic's Claude AI for personalized, age-appropriate activities
- 30-second retry system with kid-friendly waiting messages
- One regeneration attempt per activity request to prevent endless cycling
